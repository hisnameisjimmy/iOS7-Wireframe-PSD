#iOS 7 Wireframe PSD
Enjoy this token of good friendship! A fairly pixel accurate wireframe toolset for iOS 7. If you spend a lot of time in Photoshop, and you want the spacing of your wireframes to be as accurate as possible towards the final product, this is for you. I have made this with my heart.

##Acknowledgements
Some of the design of this file is based on how Teehan Lax did it with their [iOS7 GUI PSD](http://www.teehanlax.com/tools/iphone/). I love what they did, but I wanted something that was more basic and just for concepting. I stand on the shoulders of giants.

##License
I grant you, brave traveler, the [MIT license](LICENSE). So just throw my name somewhere invisible, but know that my name is awesome and so you might want to make it more visible. This is just a suggestion.
